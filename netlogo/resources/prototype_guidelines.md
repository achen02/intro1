# Prototype
NO CODE: Until you hand in the prototype there should be absolutely NO CODE! This is a design process.
You can experiment with different NetLogo features and try making mini-models as a 'working prototype' but nothing you do before the official start counts.


### Grade
This will be 20% of your final project grade. It should look like you put serious effort into it. If it looks like you did this assignment on the train coming to school or rushed it the night before, I will grade you accordingly. Diagrams can be printed images, or hand drawn. Both of you should PROOFREAD the entire document.

Hand drawn does not mean you can draw like a 5-year-old.
    - Take time to draw what you want to show. You don't have to draw everything (just the world, or include the buttons as you choose.)
    - Use a ruler for straight edges! This makes it look much better. (No ruler = you didn't care)
    - Please use reasonable paper! (Drawing on wrinkled looseleaf = you didn't care)


### Goal of the Prototype
   a. Come together with your partner and make a clear picture of what you BOTH want to do.
   b. Explicitly describe the behavior of your project so I can tell you if there are potential problems.
   c. Make clear expectations public so you have guidelines to follow and don't cut features for no reason.
   d. Have the document in class when you are working so I can reference it when I see your group.

The 2nd page is SUPER important
* Development stages
    - A timeline of features to be added, prioritized by importance and feasability.
    - It is ok to fall behind schedule.
    - It is OK to modify this.

* Keep it out in class
    - Print one for me, and one for each of you.
    - You must have it out at all times.

* Evolving document
    - You may ADD to it, but do NOT remove old pages.
    - You may mark sections as outdated, and that they are replaced later.
    - The goal is to see the evolution of your project over the 2 weeks.
