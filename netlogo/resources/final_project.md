# Final Project Guidelines
You have two options:

* Netlogo Model Extension
    - SOLO Project
    - Max Grade 94
    - You will extend 1-2 models. (2 is just in case one model runs out of reasonable things for you to do)
    - You will document exactly what code you added/changed.

* Project from Scratch
    - PAIR Project
    - Max Grade 102, but will only average in a 100
    - This is the full CS experience! - If you have high grades you SHOULD be doing the full project from scratch.
    - Prototype is part of the grade

* Both cases
    - Documentation is critical
    - Same Number of submissions


Rationale For the 94 cap:
- If everyone did a full project, some of you would spend a ton of time on it, struggle a lot, and not succeed. These projects would get low grades and are difficult to grade because they don't work and I cannot just grade on effort.
- This gives the option for an easier but still substantial project.
- You cannot get 100 on it because if you have difficulty in the class and want to opt for this you would not have gotten 100 on the full project either!
- If you are lazy, you can avoid doing as much work in a "legit" way.


### General Final Project Logistical Guidelines
1. You will be required to submit 4 versions of your project over time. Regardless of what kind of project you make.
2. You are expected to do work in class AND at home.
3. Your grade will depend on several factors beyond the actual project:
 a - Your prototype/documentation/submissions
 b - Consistent work throughout the 2 weeks. (The procrastination penalty)

### Full project
1. You should try to get the minimum requirements done early, and play with how your project looks as a last
2. It is ok if someone goes above and beyond, as long as the other partner contributes a substantial amount. It is NOT ok if one partner does most of the work, and the other does very little.


### Final Project Dates
* Jan 4th:  Prototypes required in class while you work. This should be an elaborate explanation of your goals, and picture of how you want things to work. Details to follow.
* Jan 8: 1st code submission due
* Jan 11: 2nd code submission due
* Jan 15: 3rd code submission due
* Jan 17th: Final Version due by the start of the school day.
* Jan 17-19: Showcase/Demoes

### Suggestions
Regarding games: As a game enthusiast, it pains me to STRONGLY suggest you avoid games. I have found that students tend to focus on the wrong things when making games, or just implement them poorly.  
- Original games tend not to have a good goal for you to reach. Mashup games like pacman+spaceinvaders is an exception to this.
- Clones of existing games often need modified controls to better suit the mouse+widgets mode of NetLogo. You cannot expect a game that requires keyboard input to work the way you want it to without a great deal of effort.
- If you want to do a game, you ABSOLUTELY must have at least one alternative project idea.

### Regarding Issues
The following things will NEVER hurt your grade, but can help you get your project done. Please let me know RIGHT AWAY if:
    - your partner is non-cooperative, you cannot work together effectively.
    - you and your partner cannot resolve a disagreement.
    - you are stuck on something
