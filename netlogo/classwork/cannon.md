# Cannon
Build a cannon that shoots projectiles a distance proportional to the amount of time clicking on the cannon.

## Instructions
1. Make a cannon breed and a projectile breed. The cannon and projectiles should have a heading of 315.
2. When you click and hold onto a cannon, you should be able to drag it around and move it. You should be able to drag the cannon with a mouse within a radius of 3.
3. When you click and hold onto the cannon for 3 or more seconds and then release, the projectile it shoots should be able to travel across the entire length of the world no matter where it is. (hint: think of the longest distance you can travel within a square or rectangle)
4. Holding onto the cannon for any time less than 3 seconds should shoot a projectile a distance proportional to the time. For example, if you were to hold the cannon for 2 seconds, the projectile it shoots will be able to travel 2/3 the max distance. (hint: pythagorean theorem)
5. If a projectile reaches the edge of the world, it should disappear.

### Mini-Steps
See if you can create two global variables that keep track of when you start clicking the mouse and how long you've been clicking on the mouse.

### Extra
Create three robot cannons that move around randomly and shoot at you.
