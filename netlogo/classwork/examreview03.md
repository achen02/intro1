## Exam03

### Questions
1. Assume you have three global variables: hours, minutes, and seconds that are a reflection of ticks. However in your new NetLogo world, one second is really 0.001 seconds. Write a button named `bigbang` that clears the tick counter. Write a `go` forever button that progresses time accordingly. Include in your go button the logic to update the value of hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, after 18.607 seconds have passed after clicking the `go` button, the hours should have a value of 5, minutes 10, and seconds 7.
2. Randomly generate 10 blue color patches. Create 8 turtles and randomly distribute them. Ask each turtle to move to the closest blue colored patch.
